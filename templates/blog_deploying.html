                    <h2>Deploying the Network</h2>
                    <p>
                        Now that we have our LemurNet model trained and stored as a Keras h5 file, we must face the
                        question of how to deploy it. Because it could serve an educational and, hopefully,
                        conservation purpose, we want LemurNet to be widely accessible, even for people with limited
                        resources. Therefore, we the only requirements to use LemurNet should be an Internet
                        connection, and a Web browser.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here we'll create a simple webapp, leveraging <a href="https://js.tensorflow.org/" target="_blank">TensorFlow.js</a>
                        to perform client-side
                        inference. Indeed, most of the code we'll use is adapted from the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples/tree/master/mobilenet"
                            target="_blank">official mobilenet example</a>.
                        provided by the tfjs team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We'll use <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" target="_blank">Flask</a> as our framework and <a
                            href="https://gunicorn.org/" target="_blank">gunicorn</a> as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface"
                            target="_blank">WSGI</a> server to create the webapp, and
                        deploy if on <a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a>. Heroku is a cloud
                        platform to deploy webapps, including a free plan with minor limitations. It's not the only
                        choice to deploy the website, e.g. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/" target="_blank">Google
                            App Engine</a> or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/" target="_blank">AWS
                            Elastic Beanstalk</a> are excellent alternatives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First, we need to convert our Keras model to a format that TensorFlow.js can read. This is
                        achieved using the <a href="https://js.tensorflow.org/tutorials/import-keras.html" target="_blank">tensorflow-js
                            converter</a>. In a terminal:
                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/pmdanton/c9fb20b2b1f77b2bbc6afd744af4ce1a.js"></script>
                        This generates a file called model.json, storing the model architecture, several "shards" of
                        4MB or less each that store the weights. The 4MB limit makes each piece fit in the
                        typical memory cache limit of web browsers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our webapp will be a very simple Flask app, rendering an HTML index page with some JavaScript.
                        It is structured like this:
                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/pmdanton/5807f10bb22235c6b8e4f8c67e8a3f9e.js"></script>
                        This code essentially says that the root of the website, denoted by "/", will show the page
                        index.html stored in the <i>template</i> folder located at the same level as this app.py file.
                        In this HTML file you need to load TensorFlow.js:
                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/pmdanton/f10a8e81de9704d02cc899fa0ddc2db0.js"></script>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'll only describe relevant code snippets and skip the HTML/CSS design, but you can see and
                        download the files on <a href="https://github.com/pmdanton/lemurnet-webapp" target="_blank">my
                            GitHub page</a>. Next to the template folder containing our HTML page is a folder called <i>static</i>
                        that contains our JavaScript code, and the files generated by the TensorFlow.js converter. In
                        the code above, we loaded index.js from this static folder using Flask's <i>url_for</i>
                        function.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The following code shows you how to load an image and make a prediction with the model. First,
                        we need to pre-process the image the exact same way we did for training. While in Keras the
                        pre-processing function was part of the mobilenetv2 module, here we must manually map all
                        pixels from (0,255) to (-1,+1).
                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/pmdanton/947bcbff2b355a3be21bf2d82e4d4331.js"></script>
                        The rest of the code gets the index of the top prediction (maximum probability), and returns
                        the corresponding class
                        name and probability. Once the index is calculated, returning any information (common name,
                        conservation status, even a Wikipedia summary) is just a matter of looking up in a table, so
                        we'll skip it here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Inference can be very fast, but the model needs to be loaded to memory, which can take several
                        seconds depending on the connection speed of the user. On the other hand, it only needs to be
                        loaded once, so to make things feel speedier the webapp ships an image of lemur on
                        which it performs inference immediately at launch, forcing the network to load while the user
                        discovers the Web page. When ready for prediction, each run typically takes less than 0.5
                        second on a mobile phone (Pixel and Pixel 2).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To test the app, first create a virtual environment with <a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/"
                            target="_blank">virtualenv</a> and install flask and
                        gunicorn (not required at this stage, but will be for online deployment)
                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/pmdanton/be1556549fe566509ff5bbf7ac1e668e.js"></script>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can then test an Flask webapp locally by running:
                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/pmdanton/afdb538627ad991e3cdb7b0ab53b1141.js"></script>
                        By default this will run <i>app.py</i>, so if you used another file name make sure to export it
                        first:
                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/pmdanton/36a96bcb85db3fcf8b1e2a720826f8a9.js"></script>
                        Navigate to localhost:5000 in your Web browser, and your webapp should appear! Once you have
                        verified that your app works, you're ready to deploy it online!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You'll need two more files for your app to run online: one telling what Python packages are
                        required (such as Flask), and one to configure the webserver. Generate them in the terminal:
                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/pmdanton/960ea229dc5d7dc6dcf62751ae059fb2.js"></script>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To put the app on line we'll use <a href="https://github.com/join" target="_blank">Github</a>
                        and <a href="https://signup.heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a>. Make sure you have an
                        active account on both platforms, and that git is installed on your computer:
                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/pmdanton/88119c14a93af31ec31422c5acc1f694.js"></script>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First we create a repository on GitHub: go to your dashboard and click "New". Everything should
                        be pretty straightforward, and you can use use <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/"
                            target="_blank">this page for help</a>. Let's say you called your repo "my_app". You'll
                        now push the folder on your machine (origin) to your remote repo (master):
                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/pmdanton/6c092e78dba8e413336b5f408d3f38dd.js"></script>
                        You should now see all your files on the GitHub website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Last but not least, we will configure Heroku to build the website from your GitHub repo. This
                        is incredibly simple and very visual on the Heroku dashboard. No coding is required, and this
                        blog post is too long already, so I simply refer you to the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration"
                            target="_blank">Heroku Dev Center guide to GitHub automatic deploys</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You should now have a working website! For LemurNet I upgraded Heroku to use a Hobby dyno that
                        never sleeps, and bought a domain name for the website (which is still accessible on <a href="https://lemurnet.herokuapp.com/"
                            target="_blank">lemurnet.herokuapp.com</a>). I also used <a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/flask-sslify"
                            target="_blank">Flask-SSLify</a> to redirect all trafic to HTTPS, so browsers like Chrome
                        won't mark the website as unsafe.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is now the end of these posts on how to build a deep learning webapp from scratch! I hope
                        you enjoyed it as much as I did, and above all I hope you will continue to think about lemurs
                        from time to time, and consider supporting some of the many great NGOs working for the
                        conservation of these endangered plushies. Then I would know that LemurNet has reached is true
                        target and accomplished something useful.
